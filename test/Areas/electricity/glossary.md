## Ohms
Resistance 

## Watt (Power)

$Power = V * I = \frac{V^{2}}{R} = I^{2}R$

## Ohms Law
$$
V = \frac{I}{R}
$$

## Impedance
= Resistance for Nerds

## Current
How many electrons flow through a circuit in  a second

## Polarity
Means if a component is symmetric or not
Polarised means that a component is not symmetric

## Voltage Divider

## Farad
Term | Symbol | Weight
-----------|----|------
 Picofarad  | pW | $10^{-12}$
 Nanofarad  | nF | $10^{-9}$
 Microfarad | $\micro$F | $10^{-6}$
 Milifarad  | mF | $10^{-3}$
 Kilofarad  | kF | $10^{3}$

## LED

Anode - The shorter Leg
Cathode -  The longer Leg

## Diode
## Anode
The positive end of a diode

## Cathode
The negative end of a diode

## Conventional Current Flow
When electricity was discovered people thought the electrons flow from the positive terminal to the negative, in actuality they flow in the opposite direction, but it is still possible to calculate the flow with the old way.
