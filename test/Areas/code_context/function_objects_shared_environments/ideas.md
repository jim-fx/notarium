## Spells

Gives anything its attached to a special meaning. All spells have implanted nfc so they can have a special meaning.

Ergo, the spells/sigils change the way users think about spaces, but through nfc interfaces the spells can also have actual impact.

Also every user could have his/her own sigil to interact with certain thinks.

Wooden Material to draw on so thinks can evolve.


**Examples**

- Silencio (Silent Space)
- 

### Attaching spells / sigils to stuff

**VELCRO**

+ Could stick to all types of fabric

- Does not stick to whiteboards

**MAGNETS**

+ Satisfying
+ Sticks to whiteboards

- Problems with interference with magnets

[Potential interference of small neodymium magnets with cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17198980/)

The effect of four NdFeB magnets (two spherical magnets 8 and 10 mm in diameter, a necklace made of 45 spherical magnets, and a magnetic name tag) was tested in forty-one ambulatory patients with a pacemaker and 29 patients with an ICD. The maximum distance at which the magnetic switch of a device was influenced was observed.

> Results: 
> Magnetic interference was observed in all patients. 
> The maximum distance resulting in device interference was 3 cm. 
> No significant differences were found with respect to device manufacturer and device types.
