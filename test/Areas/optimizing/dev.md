# Roadblocks

## Nested tmux sessions

If i ssh into a remote machine with tmux started aswell i have some problems:
  - Duplicate tmux bar
  - ~~Shortcuts dont work in remote~~
    - This works by hitting the prefix key twice, e.g. ctrl-a-a

## Debian Gnome sometimes comma key doesnt work

Has not happened in a while

## Neovim shortcut to comment out

Fixed this by installing the NerdCommenter Plugin

## Neovim Auto fix problems shortcut + hover window

## Better git merging in Neovim, like in VScode
