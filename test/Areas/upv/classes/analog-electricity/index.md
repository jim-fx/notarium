## 7.4 (Voltage to current Converter)

Why would I want to convert a voltage to a current?

For most digital systems we work with voltage,

Over long distances we convert voltage to current, because over distance the voltage drops due to the resistance in the wire.

Convert voltage signal 0v - 5v to current 4mA - 20mA

## 7.4 (Converters Based on OAs)

Negative feedback is when the input is connected to the negative output.

The voltage is differenctial,

## 7.43 (Converters Based on OAs)

Current-Controlled Voltage Source (i-V converter);

Transfer function is always voltage

## Homeworks

When will i get satuiration, and voltage first or current first
