## Use any editor u want?

But what if you would want to edit in your terminal?

Edit in the browser and in your terminal

maybe this is better than the old one, but, how do we fix this stuuupid debounce error

## Or try some interactives blocks:

### Like maybe latex?

$$
\frac{1}{R_E} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
$$

### Or maybe checklists?

- [x] This is a github styled checklist
- [x] With some items on it
- [x] that do not mean anything
- [x] He needs some milk
- [x] God damn boyyyyyy
- [ ] List Item
